This repo contains sample files for answering a stackoverflow question regarding imports.

I created a repo instead of just typing in the answer because that seemed like the best way to illustrate what was going on.


### how does this work?

1. Have git installed on your machine (brew install git, apt-get install git, yum install git, etc. ...) 
2. git clone git@github.com:haleemur/anagrou.git
3. cd anagrou
4. python3 main.py (here I assumed that you're running on python3, if you're on python2, it might not work)

### why did you provide me a py3 version when I'm on py2?

1. because this is meant to illustrate, so I can be lazy.
2.  most of the code transfers over, and it'll be fun for you to translate it to py2 :)
